# The Reinforcement Learning Agent

### Soft Actor Critic (SAC)
This is an implementation based on the SAC implementation of the [SLM lab](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab). It supports continuous state and action spaces
* The agent: sac_agent.py
* The network definitions: networks.py
* Replay Buffer: buffer.py

### discrete SAC (dSAC)
This is an implementation based on the SAC implementation of the [SLM lab](https://github.com/kengz/SLM-Lab). It supports continuous state space and discrete action space.
* The agent: sac_discrete_agent.py
* The network definitions: networks_discrete.py
* Replay Buffer: buffer.py
